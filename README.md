### How to run the stream?
1. Create an account @ [wit.ai](https://wit.ai/) and copy the access token to [wit.token]() 
2. Create an account @ [Firebase](firebase.google.com) and copy the access token to [firebase.token]() 

### How to run the client app?
1. Create a new client project at [Firebase](firebase.google.com) (by now you I assume you've already an account)
2. Just follow the instructions there and finally copy the `google-services.json` to [the root of the client directory.]()
